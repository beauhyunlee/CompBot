Compbot
A simple, object-oriented C++ robotics simulation where a robot can move in 2D space, update its state over time, and handle directional motion using physics-like logic.
Goal: CompBot is an object-oriented C++ robotics simulation framework that models real-time robot motion, physics, sensors, and environment interactions, designed for extensible research and prototyping.
